# Bee

Bee is a set of command-line and UI tools that automate my personal workflow.

It's still an early effort, and it doesn't do anything especially useful. Yet, I develop it in public for two reasons:

1. Anything useful to me may also be useful to someone else, and even if it's a single person, sharing makes the world a bit better place.
2. Building things in public produces better results faster.
